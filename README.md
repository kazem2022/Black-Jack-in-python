# Black-Jack-in-python
black-jack game implemented in python 

In this game, I used a dictionary to store the cards, and when I need a card value, I retrieve it using the corresponding key.

The game involves one player against the dealer (casino). Initially, the code randomly deals two cards to each player and shows the player's cards and one of the dealer's cards. It also displays the sum of the cards for each side.

After seeing their cards, the player can choose to "hit" and receive a new card, or "pass" the hand to the dealer. If the player chooses to hit and the sum of their cards exceeds 21, the player loses. If the player passes the hand to the dealer and the dealer selects a new card, and the sum of the dealer's cards exceeds 21, the dealer loses. However, if the sum is 21 or less, and higher than the player's sum, the dealer wins.
